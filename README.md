**Successful App Models for the App Store and Google Play Markets**

By diving into our app usage data, we aim to identify the types of apps that consistently gain popularity and draw in larger audiences.
- The goal of this project is straightforward: we want to provide our developers with data-driven insights into the characteristics of successful apps. These insights will help guide future development decesions, enabling us to create apps that are more likely to capture a wider user base and ultimately increase our advertising revenue.
